# Analytics Project 2026 – Dynamic Pricing & Demand Prediction

## Project Overview

This project analyzes dynamic pricing strategies in an online pharmacy setting.

Large online shops use automatic price adjustments to optimize revenue and margin at the product level. The goal is **not personalization**, but product-level price optimization aligned with market conditions.

The dataset consists of:

- `items.csv` → static product attributes
- `train.csv` → time-varying features and user interactions
- Over 2.5 million records
- User actions: click, basket, order

---

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:

1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. Engineer meaningful features
3. Train and compare **at least three classification models**
4. Predict whether a product is purchased
5. Provide **business interpretation and inference**
6. Present findings in a structured paper and presentation

## Environment Setup

### Create Virtual Environment

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
& .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import pandas, sklearn, lightgbm; print('Environment OK')"
```

---

## Running the Project

Run the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```
---

## Methodology

### Data Understanding
- Merge `items.csv` and `train.csv` via `pid`
- Inspect missing values
- Analyze distribution of `click` → `basket` → `order`
- Examine price and competitor price distributions

### Feature Engineering
- Price difference: `price - competitorPrice`
- Price ratio: `price / rrp`
- Campaign effects (`campainIndex`, `adFlag`)
- Availability encoding
- Categorical encoding (`manufacturer`, `group`, `unit`, `pharmForm`, etc.)
- Interaction effects (e.g., price gap × availability)

### Modeling (Minimum 3 Algorithms)
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest
- LightGBM (recommended for large tabular data)

### Evaluation
- ROC-AUC
- Precision / Recall
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance
- SHAP analysis (model explainability)

### Business Interpretation
- Price sensitivity signals (impact of price gap vs competitors)
- Campaign effectiveness
- Availability effect on conversion
- Revenue implications

## Business Perspective

**Central business question:**
> How does product price positioning relative to competitors influence purchase probability and revenue?

Results should support:
- Improved pricing strategies
- Better revenue optimization decisions
- Understanding of campaign impact
